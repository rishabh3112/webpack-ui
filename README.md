Feel free to open a issue with `[Feature]` prefix

## Contributing
Feel free to open a PR.

## Special Thanks
- `webpack-cli`: I orignally proposed it to be a part of webpack-cli as we can reuse the code in UI itself. Also some of the code from webpack-cli served as base for `Starters` support on UI.
